### Linked List Implementation and Unit Tests
This repository contains a Python implementation of a linked list along with a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation. The linked list operations covered include adding elements, retrieving the first and last elements, popping elements from the front and back, removing a specific element, clearing the list, and more.

## Files:
linked_list.py: The implementation of the linked list.
unittest_linked_list.py: Unit tests for the linked list functionality.
## Usage:
Ensure the linked_list.py file contains a correct implementation of the LinkedList class.
Run the unit tests using unittest_linked_list.py to validate the correctness of the linked list operations.
All tests should pass, indicating a robust and reliable linked list implementation.
