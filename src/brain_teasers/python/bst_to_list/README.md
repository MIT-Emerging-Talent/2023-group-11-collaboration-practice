This Python code contains a set of unit tests for the bst_to_double_linked_list function, which is designed to convert a Binary Search Tree (BST) into a doubly linked list. Each test case represents a different scenario:

Full Tree Test:

A sample BST is created with nodes 8, 4, 10, 3, 5, and 11.
The expected output is a doubly linked list in ascending order: [11, 10, 8, 5, 4, 3].
Empty Tree Test:

An empty tree is used as input.
The expected output is an empty doubly linked list.
Single Node Tree Test:

A tree with a single node containing the value 1 is created.
The expected output is a doubly linked list with a single node: [1].
Running the Tests
To execute the tests:

The code assumes that the bst_to_double_linked_list function is implemented in the src directory. Ensure that the correct path is set.
The unittest framework is used for testing. Running the script (unittest.main()) will execute all test cases.
