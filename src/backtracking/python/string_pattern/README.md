# Overview

This Python module contains the implementation of the 'string_pattern' function, a specialized tool for pattern matching within strings. The solution is designed to determine if a given pattern can be uniquely mapped to any substring within a specified string, with each unique character in the pattern corresponding to a unique character in the string.

# Solution Behavior

The 'string_pattern' function iterates through the string, examining each substring that matches the length of the pattern.
It attempts to map each character in the pattern to a unique character in the substring.
The function returns True if it successfully finds a consistent and unique mapping for the entire pattern within any part of the string; otherwise, it returns False.

# Strategies and Implementations

- Unique Character Mapping: The function employs a dictionary to map each character in the pattern to a character in the string. This ensures that each pattern character is associated with a unique string character.
- Consistency Check: A set is used to track characters in the string that have already been mapped, preventing duplicate mappings.
- Iterative Substring Analysis: The function examines each possible substring in a sequential manner, checking for a valid character mapping that aligns with the pattern.
- Efficiency Considerations: The implementation is designed for optimal performance in typical use cases, with a focus on minimizing unnecessary computations.

# Usage

To use the 'string_pattern' function, import it into your Python script and pass the string and pattern as arguments:

```Python
from string_pattern import string_pattern

result = string_pattern("your_string", "your_pattern")
```

# Testing

- Positive Test Cases: Verify scenarios where the pattern should be found within the string.
- Negative Test Cases: Check scenarios where the pattern should not be found within the string.
To run the tests, execute the test script using a Python test runner or directly from the command line:

```bash
python -m unittest test_string_pattern.py
```
